# manim-cs

## To set up the environment, run following commands:

```
conda create -n manim python=3.8
conda activate manim
pip install manim
pip install manimgl
```

After installing, `cd practice dir` and try `manimgl make_image.py SquareToCircle`, if you see a window pop up which renders a blue circle, you are good to go.
