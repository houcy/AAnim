# manim-cs

## Description

This is a library for data structure animation by using a Python library called Manim.

## Installation

This library uses ManimCE (instead of ManimGL, learn differences between versions [here](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/versions.html)) To set up the environment, follow [this tutorial](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html)

Also, you need to enable LaTeX, go to http://www.tug.org/mactex/ and download the full version of MacTeX.

## Validation

After installing, `cd practice` and try `manimgl make_image.py SquareToCircle`, if you see a window pop up which renders a blue circle, you are good to go.

## Working demo

You will need to `cd practice` first.
Heap operations: `manim -ql -p heap.py BuildHeap`
