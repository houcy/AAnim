# üçì Welcome to AAnim üçì

## üçì What AAnim is

A(lgorithm)Anim(ation) is a library for data structure and algorithms animation by using a Python library called Manim.

## üçì Installing Dependencies

1. pip3: You need to update pip3 to the latest version.

2. ManimCE: We use ManimCE (instead of ManimGL) to make animations. Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html).

3. manim_fonts: Run `pip3 install manim_fonts` to install manim fonts.

4. Graphviz: If you are generating graph algorithms (vs. heap), you will need to install graphviz. Simply run `brew install graphviz`

5. Clone this repo to your local environment. Make sure you are on the main branch.

## üçì Validation

After cloned the repo, `cd source` and try `python3 -m manim graph.py Test -ql`, if you see a video generated in a few seconds, you are good to go.

## üçì How to use AAnim

You will need to `cd source` first. I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ImIFlK3tw) explaining what AAnim is in details. Starting at 4:02 there is a demo on how users interact with the tool to give you a more concrete idea of how it works. The instructions below are equivalent.

### Option 1: Animate a Heap

Heap operations that we currently support are build a heap, insert, and delete. Use the following default command to try: `python3 animate_heap.py command_heap.txt`

You can also customize your command in command_heap.txt. Please follow the following format strictly. It can take any combination of the following four commands:

1. Create a heap by giving a list of numbers less than 15 elements, seperated by space. This command always need to be the first one and no duplicates. For example: `19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11`
2. Build a heap: build [min/max]. For example: `build min`
3. Extract the Min/Max: extract.
4. Insert a value and heapify: insert [integer]. For example: `insert 1`

### Option 2: Animate a Graph

We use the layout engine from [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) to get an optimized layout of a graph so you don't have to input the layout information.

1. Create a `.gv` file that describes all edges of the graph that you want to create. An example is `graph_blueprint.gv`. You need to follow the exact format to list out each edge as below:

   - 1a) For an un-weighted undirected graph:

   ```
   graph G {      # You can't modify the first line
   A -- B         # Use A -- B to represent an undirected edge
      B -- C      # Indentation is allowed but not encouraged
   C -- A
   C -- D
   Z              # An isolated node
   }              # You can't modify the last line
   ```

   - 1b) For an un-weighted directed graph:

   ```
   digraph G {    # Use digraph instead of graph
   A -> B         # Use A -> B to represent a directed edge.
   B -> C
   C -> A
   C -> D
   }
   ```

   - 1c) For a weighted unidrected graph:

   ```
   graph G {
   A -- B [xlabel=4]    # Add [xlabel=your_weight] at the end, the weight should be an integer
   B -- C [xlabel=5]
   C -- A [xlabel=2]
   C -- D [xlabel=3]
   }
   ```

2. Enter your command on termimal. The format of the command is: `python3 animate_graph.py [a) .gv file] [b) an algorithm] [c) source node]`. For example, `python3 animate_graph.py graph_blueprint.gv prim`.

   - 2a) [.gv file]: Required. The name of the .gv file you just created in step 1.
   - 2b) [an algorithm]: Required. The name of the algorithm you want to run on this graph. You can choose one from:
     - `bfs`, try `python3 animate_graph.py graph_blueprint4.gv bfs A`
     - `dfs`, try `python3 animate_graph.py graph_blueprint4.gv dfs A`
     - `prim-basic`, try `python3 animate_graph.py graph_blueprint3.gv prim-basic`
     - `prim`, try `python3 animate_graph.py graph_blueprint3.gv prim`
     - `kruskal-basic`, try `python3 animate_graph.py graph_blueprint3.gv kruskal-basic`
     - `kruskal`, try `python3 animate_graph.py graph_blueprint3.gv kruskal`
     - `dijkstra`, try `python3 animate_graph.py graph_blueprint6.gv dijkstra A`
     - `bellmanford`, try `python3 animate_graph.py graph_blueprint6.gv bellmanford A`
   - 2c) [source node]: Optional. If you choose `bfs`, `dfs`, `dijkstra` or `bellmanford`, this argument is required. If you choose `kruskal-basic` or `kruskal`, the argument is not allowed. For other algorithms, the argument is optional.

A image, `output.png`, will be generated in about 3 seconds in `source` directory just in case you are curious what the graph look like after position being calculated.

Normally a video of 100 animations would take around 6 mins to generate. It's not fast so be patient :)

## üçì WIP

1. We are working on an online version of it to save your time on waiting.
2. We are working on creatin a invisible box to scale the graph so that it won't overlap.
3. We are working on a new feature to enable you to specify a layout engine among `dot`, `neato`, `twopi`, `circo`, `fdp`, `osage`, `sfdp`, which are supported by Graphviz. It's not implemented yet.

The above instructions were tested only on Mac OS X Intel version. Feel free to give it a try anyway and let me know if it doesn't work on your env and we can figure it out together. We thank you for choosing AAnim! If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact Joy: zhuozhuo530[at]gmail.
